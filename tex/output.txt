In this paper, we are concerned with the existence of solutions for the Bakada equation.
{\bf AMS subject classification.} 00X00.
In this paper, we discuss the initial boundary value problem of the following Bakada equation with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.
EQUATION where EQ is a bounded domain in EQ with smooth boundary EQ;
EQ is an unknown function;
EQ and EQ are positive constants.
The Bakada equation was proposed by Kumasan \cite{Kumasan} in 1901 as a mathematical model to describe the ecology of bears in Hilbert space.
