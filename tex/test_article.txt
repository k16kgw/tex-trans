  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  In this paper, we discuss the initial boundary value problem 
  of the following Bakada equation with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition.
  \begin{equation}\label{BE}
    \beta a = ka \Lap a,\ x\in\Omega,
  \end{equation}
  where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$;
  $a:[0, T]\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ is an unknown function;
  $\beta$ and $k$ are positive constants.
    The Bakada equation was proposed by Kumasan \cite{Kumasan} in 1901 
    as a mathematical model to describe the ecology of bears in Hilbert space.
